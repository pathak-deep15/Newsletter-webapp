# Newsletter webapp

This is a web application with which user can sign up for a newsletter (Just signup is done. No news letter is being sent). 

I have deployed the web application on heroku server. Check this out:- https://glacial-savannah-67987.herokuapp.com/

Front end is done with HTML, CSS(along with Bootstrap). Back end is done with Node.js and Express.

Mailchimp API has been used to store the data of the users who have signed up for the newsletter.

I hope you will like it. Feel free to suggest any improvements :) .
